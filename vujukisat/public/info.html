			<h3>How are scores calculated</h3>

			<p>
				Finishing a boulder problem grants 1 point. <br>
				Finishing a lead route grants 3 points. <br>
				Lead routes also have 2 zones worth 1 and 2 points. <br>
				<br>

				The climber with the most total points wins. If the scores between two climbers are the same, the amount of attempts 
				used in all bouldering ascents are used to determine which one is ranked higher.
			</p>


			<h3>How to log ascents?</h3>

			<p>
				Boulders: <br>
				Log the amount of attempts you took to complete the boulder to the attempts field. Then click the Add ascent button.
				To remove an ascent just click the remove ascent button.
				<br>
				<br>
				Lead: <br>
				Choose the option that represents how far you got on the route. Removing ascents works the same way as in boulders.
